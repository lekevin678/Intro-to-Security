# Hash-Resistance-Properties
Test the weak-resistance and strong-resistance properties of SHA-256. Only uses the first 24 bits of the hashes. Both weak-resistance and strong-resistance runs 100 times and the average number of trials to break the property is calculated.

To Compile and Run:
  python hash-resistance.py
  
Skills: Python, Object-Oriented Design, Cryptographic Hashes
